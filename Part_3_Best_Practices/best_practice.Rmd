# File Structure

## Folders

- Folders/Directories should be organized in a manner that's easy to
    + follow and identify content 
    + replicate
    
- Project Folder should include the following subfolders:
    + Script
    + Original Data
    + Modified (or Analysis) Data
    + Results
    + README
    
- Additional Reading:
   Project TIER: (https://www.projecttier.org/documents/3/TIER-Protocol-2.0-for-R.pdf)

# Script Structure

## Script

- Layout includes:
    + Preamble
    + Libraries/ Import
    + Data Setup
    + Analysis
    + Graphics/Tables
    + Export
    
## Preamble    
- Title/Project
- Author (optional)
- Purpose of Script File
- Previous Dependent Script File
- Subsequent Dependent Script File
- Notes

## Libraries/Import
- include major libraries used for file to run
    + allow others to know what packages they need to install to use your code
- import all data to be used in one section
    + shows other user all relevant data file necessary for analysis or code functionality

## Data Setup
- Any data cleaning or restructuring necessary for data use
- May include subsection to allow readers to understand what is done for which data

## Analysis
- Include comments on the type of analysis or calculation being performed 
    + if the calculation is for a specific table, name the table
    + e.g., \# Table 1 in CSR 

## Graphics/Tables
- Include comments on the type graphs being generated
    + include figure name if used in specific report
    + e.g., \# Figure 1 for Council Report
    
## Save/Export
- Identify the data objects being saved or exported for later use


# Syntax Structure

## Spacing 
- Spaces around assigment and operators
    + Includes: <-, +, -, =, ==, &, &&
- Space only after comma (not before)
- Extra space for alignment
- Space before left parentheses except in a call function

    ```{r spacing, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
basic  <- list(
  total = a + b + c, 
  mean  = (a + b + c) / n)

```

## Curly Braces
- opening curly brace ( { ) should never go on its own line
- always followed by a new line
- closing curly brace ( } ) should always go on its own line

    ```{r braces, echo=TRUE, warning=FALSE, error=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
if (y < 0 & debug) {
  message(“Y is negative”)
}

```

## Indentation
- Be consistent
- Use two spaces or tab
- Don't mix spaces and tab

## Line Length
- 80 characters
- Within the viewing frame
