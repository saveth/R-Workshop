## Review Objects

- Scalar
- Vector
- Matrix
- Array
- List


# Visualize Objects



##  Scalar as a dot/coin
![](../images/scalar.jpg)

##  Vector as a line/bar
![](../images/vector.jpg)

##  Matrix as a square/paper
![](../images/matrix.jpg)

##  Array as a cube/box
![](../images/array.jpg)

##  List as a container/chest
![](../images/list.jpg)

## Indexing


```{r index, echo=TRUE}
mat <- matrix(1:6,4,6)
arr <- array(1:40, dim = c(4,5,2))

mat[3,4]
```

- What is the index for arr containing the value 36?
- arr[4,4,2]

# Library


## Library packages

```{r base, include=FALSE}

library(help = "base")

```

- Packages contains funtions and data not included in the base package

- Programers develop packages for specific disciplines or simplifying their coding process

- Beaware that a function in one package can mask a function in another package

    ```{r libraries, echo=TRUE}
library(dplyr)

```

## Import Files

- What type of data files do we normally work with?
    + Excel
    + Stata
    
- Libraries for Excel
    + library(utils)*
    + library(readr)
    + library(readxl)
    + library(openxlsx)

- Libraries for Stata
    + library(foreign)
    + library(readstata13)

- Other packages exist to read other data format    

    *Do not need to load this package.

## What functions are available in the foreign package?

## Read file examples

```{r readin, echo=TRUE}


```

## Export Files


## Concepts covered
1. Conceptual framework of data objects
2. Indexing
3. Library packages
4. Read (import) in data
5. Write (export) out data

## Exercises

- Read in the OBJ.RDS data file
    + Extract the first object in the list and save it to an object
    + Extract the second object in the list and save it to a different object
    + What are now the different types of data objects that exist in your Evironment?

- Imagine the first object came from one data source and the second data object came from a second data source, how would you go about validating the data?
    + Did the two data source collect the same information?
    + Are there any discrepancies?
    
- If the first data source is considered the most valid data, modify and update the second data source if any discrepancies exist.
